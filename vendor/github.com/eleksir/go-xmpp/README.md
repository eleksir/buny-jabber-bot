go-xmpp
=======

go xmpp library.

[Original](https://github.com/rsc/rsc/blob/master/xmpp/xmpp.go) was done by [Russ Cox](https://github.com/rsc), then
forked by [Yasuhiro Matsumoto](https://github.com/mattn).

Since both of them have amost zero interest in continuing develop of this lib, i decide to fork it.

Documentation can be found at [godoc project](https://godoc.org/github.com/eleksir/go-xmpp)

This fork mainains my needs for xmpp protocol. Feel free to contribute via PR-s if you find it interesing too and feel
that it needs more love than it already has.
