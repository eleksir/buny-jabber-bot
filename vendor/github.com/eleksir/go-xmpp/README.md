go-xmpp
=======

go xmpp library.

[Original](https://github.com/rsc/rsc/blob/master/xmpp/xmpp.go) work done by [Russ Cox](https://github.com/rsc), 
then [Yasuhiro Matsumoto](https://github.com/mattn) fork it and continue to improve it.

Since both of them have almost zero interest to continue develop this lib, I decide to fork it.

Documentation can be found at [godoc project](https://godoc.org/github.com/eleksir/go-xmpp)

This fork maintains my needs for xmpp protocol. Feel free to contribute via PR-s if you find it interesting too and feel
that it needs more love than it already has. And of course fell free to for it if needed.
